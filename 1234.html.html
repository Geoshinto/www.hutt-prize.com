<h3>
The HULT Prize is one of the largest and most prestigious global competitions for social entrepreneurship. It is often referred to as the Nobel Prize for students due to its focus on solving some of the world’s most pressing challenges through innovative, entrepreneurial solutions.

Founded in 2009 by Babatunde "Tunde" Ogunnaike, the HULT Prize is supported by the Hult International Business School and the United Nations. The competition is designed to inspire students from around the world to come up with scalable and sustainable business ideas that address global issues.

Mission and Vision:
The main mission of the HULT Prize is to provide students with the resources, mentorship, and funding to create scalable and socially impactful businesses that solve critical challenges such as poverty, access to education, healthcare, and clean energy.

Competition Structure:
Regional Summits: The competition begins with Regional Summits held at various prestigious universities around the world. These summits are organized in major cities such as New York, London, San Francisco, and Dubai. The events bring together student teams from universities and other educational institutions to pitch their innovative business ideas.

The Challenge: Each year, the HULT Prize issues a global challenge focused on a specific problem or area. Past challenges have included themes such as:

"Harnessing the Power of Energy" (2011)
"Food for Good" (2017)
"Youth Unemployment" (2019)
"The Future of Food" (2020)
"Redesigning Fashion" (2021)
"Climate Change" (2022)
Each challenge has a specific theme that teams must design a sustainable, scalable, and profitable business model around.

Global Final: The winning teams from each regional summit advance to the HULT Prize Global Finals, which are held annually. This event gathers students, business leaders, and influential figures from around the world. The final winner receives a $1 million investment to help scale their idea into a viable social enterprise.

Judges & Mentors: The competition is judged by a panel of high-profile business leaders, social entrepreneurs, and change-makers. Past judges and mentors have included figures such as:

Bill Clinton, former U.S. President
Richard Branson, Founder of Virgin Group
Sheryl Sandberg, Former COO of Facebook
Global Impact: The HULT Prize aims to create lasting, meaningful social change by empowering young people to develop solutions to the most challenging global issues. As of 2023, the HULT Prize has impacted millions of people globally through its student-driven social enterprises.

Eligibility:
The competition is open to university students (undergraduate and graduate).
Participants typically form teams of 3-5 members to compete and submit their business solutions.
Teams are often mentored by professionals in the field and are provided with resources and support to help turn their ideas into real-world solutions.
Impact and Alumni:
Many HULT Prize alumni have gone on to create successful startups, non-profits, and social enterprises, tackling issues such as:

Affordable healthcare
Clean energy solutions
Sustainable agriculture
Access to education
Water purification and sanitation
The network of HULT Prize winners and participants extends globally, with many teams continuing to receive support even after the competition, helping them scale and implement their solutions.

It provides the tools, funding, and mentorship to turn their innovative ideas into real-world change, making it one of the most impactful and prestigious challenges for young entrepreneurs today.
